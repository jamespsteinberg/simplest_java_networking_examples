Networking

TCP: A reliable way to send code, order sent is same received, delivery is guaranteed
UDP: A quick way to send code, order not guaranteed, delivery not guaranteed


TCP Types of Networking
	1. URL: Reads the source code from webpages 
		// good for getting up-to-date info on weather, stocks, etc
	2. URLConnection: Opens a datastream with a website server
		// capabilities are endless: can include creating a global online game or performing mundane online tasks (like say sending all your facebook friends a message on their walls by the click of a button)
		- Try learning how to send POST data through html forms (HTTP POST METHOD) // You could use this to get past buttons on websites (This is one way a spambot could create an account on a site and post spam instantly)
	3. Socket / ServerSocket: Creates a two way datastream to send between computers
		// through use of multithreading (running different code at nearly simultaneous times) possibilities are endless: creating lan game or chat in school
		// currently, I couldn't get the clients to communicate to eachother through multithreading, please email me if you do get it
	Notes on Socket / ServerSocket (Clients and Servers):
		-A client can connect to only Server
		-A Server can accept many many clients
		-A single computer can run multiple clients and servers at once (if you want to test networking code and you only have one computer)
		-The Server must run before any of the clients
		- only 2 computers possible unless you use multithreading
		- Client needs to provide hostname of server and port number
		- Server needs to provide port number

UDP Types of Networking
	1. DatagramPacket/DatagramSocket/MulticastSocket: Independent packet of information from server to client or vice-versa (no dedicated sockets needed)
	
	Notes on DatagramPacket/DatagramSocket/MulticastSocket: 
		-As far as I know, basically same rules as Socket/ServerSocket except the Client needs to provide only the hostname
		-Can broadcast from Server to all Clients at once
		- not entirely sure on this subject, email me if you understand it


Final Word:

	I Provide an example of URL, a Socket/ServerSocket program, and a Socket/ServerSocket program with multithreading so its across more than 2 computers

	When you create something cool with the code I have provided to play with, email it to me.
	It is only fair that since I gave you a starting point, you give me games to play with...and I might learn something too.
